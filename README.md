Overview 
---

This project is a Tamagotchi configurator where you can customize your virtual pet by selecting different themes and interacting with buttons to trigger cute animations! 🥚✨
Built with React Three Fiber, it leverages Three.js to bring the Tamagotchi to life inside a ReactJS framework. To optimize loading and manage themes and textures efficiently, I used Zustand for state management.
The 3D model was entirely created in Blender 3D, while all textures and characters were hand-drawn and painted by me in Adobe Photoshop. The adorable animations of the creatures were also animated by me in Adobe Animate.

The only thing I didn’t create? The music, which was composed by [AudioCoffee](https://www.audiocoffee.net)! 🎵

Hope you enjoy playing with it! 🚀🐾
